\subsection{Integrals and Arc Length}

We define the integral of a vector function in much the same way that we defined the derivative of a vector function:

\begin{definition}{Integral of Vector Function}
The indefinite integral of a vector function with respect to $t$ is done coordinatewise. That is, for $$\vcr(t)=\bmat{x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)}, $$
$$\int \vcr(t) \ dt=\bmat{\int x(t)\ dt\\ \int y(t)\ dt\\ \int z(t)\ dt}. $$
Similarly, the definite integral is defined:
$$\int_a^b \vcr(t) \ dt=\bmat{\int_a^b x(t)\ dt\\ \int_a^b y(t)\ dt\\ \int_a^b z(t)\ dt}. $$
\end{definition}

This doesn't have a particularly relevant geometric definition, as we're integrating a parametric function. It can kind of best be thought of as an ``accumulation function", where we're accumulating the change in $\vcr(t)$ over some interval of time. It's also just helpful as notation for the antiderivative, i.e. if you're given the velocity function you can integrate to recover the position function, etc.

\begin{exercise}{Antidifferentiating}
Suppose you have a projectile that is moving in 3-d space with velocity function $$\vcv(t)=\bmat{\sin(t)\\t\\t^2},$$ and at time $t=0$ the projectile is at the origin. What is $\vcr(t)$, the position function for this projectile?
\end{exercise}

Something that \textit{does} have relevant geometry is the \textit{arc length}. You may recall the arc length formula from Calculus II for a curve $y=f(x)$ on the $x$-interval $[a,b]$ as:

$$\ell(x)=\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+\left(\tfrac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} \ dx. $$

We also saw a parametric version of this same curve, where $f$ is parameterized via an $x(t)$, $y(t)$:

$$\ell(t)=\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\tfrac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\tfrac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}\ dt. $$

And in fact, given the function $$\vcr(t)=\bmat{x(t)\\y(t)}, $$ this is exactly the integral:
$$\ell(t)=\int_{a}^{b} ||\vcr\vprime(t)|| \ dt. $$

\begin{definition}{Arc Length of a Curve}
Let $\vcr(t)$ be a $n$-dimensional vector valued function. Then the \textbf{arc length} of $\vcr(t)$ between $t=a$ and $t=b$ is $$\ell(t)=\int_{a}^{b} ||\vcr\vprime(t)|| \ dt. $$
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}{Arc Length of a Stretchy Helix}
Let $$\vcr(t)=\bmat{\sin t\\ \cos t\\ \frac{t^2}{2}}.$$ Find the length of \href{https://www.geogebra.org/3d/e34aasz5}{this curve (Geogebra Link)} from $t=0$ to $t=2\pi$.
